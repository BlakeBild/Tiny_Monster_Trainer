To start you can only have up to two Monsters with you.  
If you get an additional Monster, you will be asked you to select one & let it go.  
Every 10 Trainer Levels you can have an additional Monster with you, up to a maximum of 5.  
Your Trainer Level also influences how well your Active Monster can fight.  
The higher your Trainer Level, you'll seek out stronger Roaming Monsters to fight.  

**Monster Stats**  
**Health**: Amount of Health the Monster can have.  
**Agility**: Used to determine who attacks first and chance to dodge an attack.  
**Strength**: Used to determine damage for physical attacks.  
**Endurance**: Used to determine defense for physical attacks.  
**Mysticism**: Used to determine damage for magical attacks.   
**Tinfoil**: Used to determine defense for magical attacks.

Updates as of 1/3/22:
Changed combat math so that the potential for high agility monsters avoiding all damage, all the time, was hopefully removed.   
Added a couple of monster parts.  
Added some visuals to help with navigating the game.  
Rewrote some functions to be the same, they just take up less lines.  
Removed some errors that caused the game to break.  
Fixed some things that weren't working as intended.  
(more specific information can be found in the update history up to this point)  

Random thoughts as of 12/24/21:
Future things I'd like to do/add:  
(Probably will need to wait until i get a physical thumby to see what I can do for these things)  
A way to store additional monsters that aren't with you. (I want to add a campfire you can visit & swap out monsters at)  
Add a way to change the world seed (Thinking about adding an item you might be able to find after a specific trainer level, that when used will change the player's world seed)   
Change Info, in battle, so that you can only see the other monsters info after a specific trainer level.  
Multiplayer (for trading and battling)    
Redo some combat maths.  
Rewrite a few fuctions to be smaller.    
Balance some stuff.    
Clean up Player Creation.  
More terrain images (based on room element type)   
More animations (I would like to add 2 more training animations, one for HP/Agi & one for Myst/Tin) (I would like to have an animation for mutating) (attack animations, based on type or if they're physical or magic)
